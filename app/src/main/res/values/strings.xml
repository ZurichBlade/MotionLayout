    <string name="himalaya_info">The Himalayas, or Himalaya is a mountain range separating the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. The range has some of the planet\'s highest peaks, including the very highest, Mount Everest which lies on the border of China and Nepal. Over 100 peaks exceeding 7,200m (23,600ft) in elevation lie in the Himalayas. By contrast, the highest peak outside Asia (Aconcagua, in the Andes) is 6,961m (22,838ft) tall.[2]The Himalayas abut or cross five countries: Bhutan, India, Nepal, China, and Pakistan. The Himalayan range is bordered on the northwest by the Karakoram and Hindu Kush ranges, on the north by the Tibetan Plateau, and on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Some of the world\'s major rivers, the Indus, the Ganges, and the Tsangpo–Brahmaputra, rise in the vicinity of the Himalayas, and their combined drainage basin is home to some 600 million people; 53 million people live in the Himalayas.[3] The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia and Tibet. Many Himalayan peaks are sacred in Hinduism, Jainism[4] and Buddhism; the summits of several—Kangchenjunga (from the Indian side), Gangkhar Puensum, Machapuchare, Nanda Devi and Kailas in the Tibetan Transhimalaya—are off-limits to climbers. </string>
